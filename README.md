# Foster

##Abstract
Grabs system and user information in a UWP (Universal Windows Platform) context.

##Goal
Foster is a UWP/Windows 10/Windows Store targeted library for gathering both user and system information for the current Win RT device. In order to be compatible with all UWP devices (including Surface, IoT, desktop, Xbox, Phone), Foster only makes use of traditional Win32 calls that are supported by UWP. The final version of this library will gather as much information as it can to create a profile for the logged in user with their account name and avatar, as well as in-depth stats on the hardware and system settings for their device. This profile information will be stored in a struct that can be exported and utilized by other applications.

##Permissions
NOTE: Your App's package.appxmanifest file will need the Removable Storage option checked for this library to function properly.

##API Contracts Used
Coming Soon!
