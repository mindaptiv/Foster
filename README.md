# Foster

##Abstract
Grabs system and user information in a Win RT/Metro context.

##Goal
Foster is a Windows RT/Windows 8/Windows 8.1/Metro targeted library for gathering both user and system information for the current Win RT device. In order to be compatible with a variety of WinRT devices (including Surface devices and PC's running Windows 8 or Windows 8.1), Foster only makes use of traditional Win32 calls that are supported by WinRT. The final version of this library will gather as much information as it can to create a profile for the logged in user with their account name and avatar, as well as in-depth stats on the hardware and system settings for their device. This profile information will be stored in a struct that can be exported and utilized by other applications.
